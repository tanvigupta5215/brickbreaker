#BRICK BREAKER

This game was made as a part of the final assignment of the standford course.In this game there are rows of different colour bricks, 
a ball and a paddle.To play this game we have 3 chances that means we need to save the ball with paddle if the ball doesnt touch paddle 
it goes down and we lose a chance. If all the bricks are broken within 3 chances, so we win the game.
